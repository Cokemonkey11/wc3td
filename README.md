78. x serpant wards are not air
79. x dragon has no tooltip for incinerate
81. x sky-fury op
82. x firestorm range is low
83. x gryphon rider perma-stun is too stunny
85. ultra towers:
    - mountain king: insane knockbacks and explosion deaths
    - blademaster: dashes and ultraviolence slices
    - dreadlord: mass sleep, mass life-siphon, souls accumulate and burst out
    - demon hunter: 10,000 damage short-range attack; after attacking, bursts up to 3x finger of pains that instagib targets
86. x 215 gold for orc hero tower builder is too steep
87. x rifleman and sorceress are not "organic" units

89. x ghoul tooltip indicates that it can fight
90. x unholy frienzy has an annoying hotkey
91. x blood mage is not an organic unit
